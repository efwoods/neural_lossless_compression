Using pyflac, a python library for FLAC compression, a lossless codec for audio data, to attempt compression by applying the algorithm to each channel's data separately. 

Oddly enough, even though the data should be a good approximation to audio data, FLAC does worse than zip methods in compression, even with the highest compression level.
